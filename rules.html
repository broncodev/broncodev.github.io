        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        <p>
          Pinko is about power. A player wins by currently owning 7 Assets or
          120 Credits. Alternatively, a player may win by being the last not
          eliminated.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          Each player chooses a Player Marker and places it at the START space.
          Each player receives
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>10 Asset Markers (person-shaped beads)</li>
          <li>15 Credits</li>
          <li>1 Rule Card</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Players roll to determine who goes first and who collects the first
          Rule Card. Turns will go clockwise after the first player.
        </p>

        <h2>Each Turn</h2>
        <p>
          Before they roll, the player may use any number of their Rule cards
          (see Rule Cards).<br /><br />

          The player must roll the die and move to end their turn. The player
          moves their pawn the number of spaces corresponding to the dice. If
          they drop one die on the floor this die's value is void. If passing
          Start, the player collects Rule Cards.<br /><br />

          If both die show the same number upon rolling (doubles) the current
          player draws an Event card.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>
          Assets are spaces on the board that can be acquired by players. Land
          on an unowned Asset to collect its Return Fee in Credits. Land on an
          owned Asset and you must pay the owning player the Return Fee. The
          Return Fee will often be modified by Rule cards throughout the
          game.<br /><br />

          If multiple players arrive at the same time, an auction can be started
          between them to acquire the Asset. Auction price starts at 1 Credit
          and goes up.<br /><br />

          Each 3 Assets held increases Rule Card gain by 1. This does not apply
          to Rule Card effects or Events.

      <section>
        <h2>Rule Cards</h2>
        <p>
          Rule cards allow players to influence the way the game is played. Some
          have an effect that takes place instantly (such as gaining an amount
          of Credits), while others are placed on the board or in front of a
          player.<br /><br />

          Most Rule cards can only be played before a player rolls on their
          turn. Blitz Rule cards are an exception and may be used during other
          players' turns.<br /><br />

          Rule Cards are gained when a player passes Start or lands on a Collect
          Rule space. Rule Cards, Event Cards, and Assets can be sold at any
          time for 5 Credits each.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Event Cards</h2>
        <p>
          Event cards must be played instantly. Their effect takes place after
          the player moves their Marker on a roll. Then they are placed upside
          down beneath the deck. The deck should be shuffled once all cards have
          been drawn once.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Shop</h2>
        <p>The Shop allows players to buy Rule Cards.</p>
        <h2>Time Machine</h2>
        <p>
          Players may arrive at Time Machine spaces on either side of the board.
          They are teleported instantly to the opposite Time Machine space.
