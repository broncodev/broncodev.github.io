            This is the site where I talk about myself <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">narcissistically</span>!

            We can start with the board game I invented.

            <summary>In Pinko, you get to change the rules of the society to benefit you and your allies.</summary>
            <p>This is based on the history of the Soviet Union, where corruption and propoganda overpowered any honest worker.
                It isn't quite ready for mass production yet, but it is quite fun to play (if I say so myself).</p>

            But isn't a programmer supposed to make games digitally?

        <h2>Arcados: Zombies In Your Browser</h2>

        <details>
        <summary>Arcados plays similarly to the Zombies mode in Call of Duty.</summary>
        <p>From a technical standpoint, the game itself is stored within a single html file (and hosted by this site, itch.io).
            Back when I worked on it, I found it very interesting to see how far I could push the level of polish with the given constraints. 
            I believe it includes over 4,000 lines of JavaScript. You can play it with this link.
