        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        <p>Pinko is about power. A player wins by currently owning 7 Assets or 120 Credits. Alternatively, a player may win by being the last not eliminated.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Each player chooses a Player Marker and places it at the START space. Each player receives</p>
            <ul>
                <li>10 Asset Markers (person-shaped beads)</li>
                <li>15 Credits</li>
                <li>1 Rule Card</li>
            </ul><p>Players roll to determine who goes first and who collects the first Rule Card. Turns will go clockwise after the first player.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Each Turn</h2>
        <p>Before they roll, the player may use any number of their Rule cards (see Rule Cards).<br><br>

            The player must roll the die and move to end their turn. 
            The player moves their pawn the number of spaces corresponding to the dice. 
            If they drop one die on the floor this die's value is void.  
            If passing Start, the player collects Rule Cards.<br><br>
            
            If both die show the same number upon rolling (doubles) the current player draws an Event card.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>Assets are spaces on the board that can be acquired by players. 
            Land on an unowned Asset to collect its Return Fee in Credits. 
            Land on an owned Asset and you must pay the owning player the Return Fee. 
            The Return Fee will often be modified by Rule cards throughout the game.<br><br>

            If multiple players arrive at the same time, an auction can be started between them to acquire the Asset. 
            Auction price starts at 1 Credit and goes up.<br><br>
            
            Each 3 Assets held increases Rule Card gain by 1. This does not apply to Rule Card effects or Events.
